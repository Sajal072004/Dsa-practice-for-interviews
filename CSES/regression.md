# *Decision Tree & Random Forest* 🌳🌲  

Decision Tree and Random Forest are *supervised learning algorithms* used for both *classification and regression* tasks. They work by splitting data into branches based on feature values, making them *easy to interpret* and highly effective.

---

## *1. Decision Tree 🌳*
A Decision Tree is a *tree-like structure* where:  
- Each *node* represents a feature (attribute).  
- Each *branch* represents a decision (split).  
- Each *leaf* represents an outcome (class label or regression value).  

### *Example: Should You Play Outside?*  
| Weather  | Temperature | Wind | Play? |
|----------|------------|------|-------|
| Sunny    | Hot        | Weak | No    |
| Cloudy   | Cool       | Strong | Yes   |
| Rainy    | Mild       | Weak | Yes   |

A decision tree could look like:  

           Weather?
         /    |    \
     Sunny  Rainy  Cloudy
      /        \      |
   Wind?     Temp?   Yes
  /    \     /    \
Weak  Strong Hot  Mild
 |       |    |     |
 No      Yes  No    Yes

It *splits data* at each step based on feature values, like “Is it sunny?” or “Is the wind weak?”

### *2. How Does a Decision Tree Work?*
*Step 1:* Choose the *best feature* to split the data.  
*Step 2:* Split the dataset based on that feature.  
*Step 3:* Repeat until all data is classified or stopping conditions are met.  

#### *How to Choose the Best Split?*
We use *impurity measures* like:
- *Gini Impurity:* Measures how mixed the classes are.
  \[
  Gini = 1 - \sum p_i^2
  \]
- *Entropy (Information Gain):* Measures uncertainty in data.
  \[
  Entropy = -\sum p_i \log_2(p_i)
  \]

*Example:*  
If a node has 10 samples (7 "Yes" and 3 "No"), Gini impurity is:
\[
1 - (0.7^2 + 0.3^2) = 0.42
\]
The split that reduces impurity the most is chosen.

## *3. Random Forest 🌲🌲🌲*
Random Forest is an *ensemble learning method* that builds *multiple decision trees* and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

### *How It Works:*
1️⃣ *Creates multiple decision trees* on random subsets of data.  
2️⃣ *Averages their predictions* (regression) or takes a *majority vote* (classification).

### *4. Difference Between Decision Tree & Random Forest*
| Feature       | Decision Tree 🌳 | Random Forest 🌲🌲 |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Overfitting  | High risk 😬    | Low risk ✅    |
| Accuracy     | Moderate 📉     | High 📈       |
| Speed        | Fast ⏩         | Slower 🐢     |
| Interpretability | Easy ✅  | Harder ❌      |

## *5. C++ Logic for Decision Tree*
Since you use *C++*, here’s a high-level logic for building a decision tree:

1️⃣ *Load the dataset*  
2️⃣ *Compute Gini/Entropy* for all possible splits  
3️⃣ *Choose the best split*  
4️⃣ *Recursively build the tree*  
5️⃣ *Make predictions by traversing the tree*
