# 🚀 DSA & Competitive Programming Practice Tracker

Welcome to my **DSA & Competitive Programming Repository**! 💻✨
This is my personal hub for all the coding problems I've solved — organized by **company**, **topic**, and **contest sheets** like the CP31 Sheet by TLE Eliminator.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to **track and structure my DSA and CP journey**, whether it's interview prep for top tech companies, topic-wise mastery of data structures and algorithms, or upsolving problems from contests.
If you're preparing for interviews or aiming to improve in competitive programming, you'll find this collection useful and organized.

## 🌟 Why This Matters?

* **Multiple Perspectives**: Whether you're targeting a company, mastering a topic, or competing — there's something for each track.
* **In-Depth Solutions**: Each solution is written with clarity, explaining the approach, edge cases, and time-space complexity.
* **Progress Tracking**: This helps me stay consistent while giving back to others preparing like me.
