Welcome to my **Company-Wise DSA Questions Repository**! üéØ This repository is my personal collection of curated and solved DSA questions, categorized by the companies that frequently ask them in technical interviews.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository is designed to help anyone preparing for coding interviews with top tech companies. By sharing my journey and solutions, I hope to provide a structured pathway to cracking those tough interviews and gaining a deeper understanding of core data structures and algorithms.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **Company** and within each company's folder, you will find:

1. **Problems** - The question statement, constraints, and edge cases.
2. **Solutions** - My approach to solving the problem, explained with time and space complexity analysis.
3. **Code** - Clean, readable code implementations of the solutions in Python, C++, or JavaScript (or any other relevant languages).

### Example Structure:

```
|-- Google/
|   |-- Problem_1.md
|   |-- Solution_1.cpp
|   |-- Problem_2.md
|   |-- Solution_2.py
|
|-- Amazon/
|   |-- Problem_1.md
|   |-- Solution_1.js
|   |-- Problem_2.md
|   |-- Solution_2.cpp
```

## üß† Key Insights

For each company, I focus on the most common question patterns that are frequently asked. You'll find detailed explanations of **patterns** such as sliding windows, binary search, dynamic programming, and more. Each solution is written with clarity and precision to align with real-world interview expectations.

## üåü Why This Matters?

- **Company Focused**: You get insights into the specific types of problems each company prioritizes, which can give you an edge during preparation.
- **In-Depth Explanations**: My solutions go beyond code, offering step-by-step breakdowns of the problem-solving process.
- **Real Interview Prep**: These questions have been sourced from actual interviews, making this a valuable resource for serious contenders.

## üí° How to Use This Repository?

1. **Explore by Company**: Choose a company you're targeting and dive into the questions relevant to that company.
2. **Review Solutions**: Study the solutions, paying attention to edge cases and optimization strategies.
3. **Practice Your Own**: After understanding the approach, try implementing the solution on your own to solidify your knowledge.
4. **Engage**: Feel free to contribute by solving more questions, suggesting optimizations, or asking questions.
